## Introduction
I am passionate about backend development and have been exploring various technologies to build robust and scalable applications. This repository serves as a documentation of my journey, sharing the knowledge gained and projects undertaken.

## Technologies
- **Node.js**: A powerful JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.
- **Express.js**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used for storing and retrieving data efficiently.
- **Authentication**: Implementation of user authentication using industry-standard practices.
- **MVC Architecture**: Building applications following the Model-View-Controller architectural pattern.
- **API Development**: Creating RESTful APIs for seamless communication between frontend and backend.

## Projects
### 1. Authentication System
I've implemented a secure authentication system using JWT Token for handling user authentication strategies.

### 2. MVC Structure
Explored and applied the MVC architectural pattern to organize code for better maintainability and scalability.

### 3. API Development
Built RESTful APIs for various functionalities, ensuring smooth communication between frontend and backend.

### 4. MongoDB Integration
Explored and integrated MongoDB as the database of choice for storing and retrieving data efficiently.

## Learning Highlights
- Understanding the importance of middleware in Express.js.
- Leveraging JWT for efficient authentication.
- Structuring code using the MVC pattern for maintainability.
- Implementing secure RESTful APIs.
- Working with MongoDB for data storage and retrieval.

## Next Steps
My learning journey doesn't stop here! I plan to explore the following areas next:
- Real-time communication using WebSockets.
- Error Handling in nodejs
- Deployment
- Docker and more.
## Getting Started
